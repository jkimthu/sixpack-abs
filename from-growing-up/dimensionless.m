%% dimensionless 

%  Goal: plot growth rate as a function of a dimensionless timescale, 
%        representing  period length as a fraction of doubling time.

%        In otherwords, plot MU vs (period length/doubling time)
%        where, MU can be:


%  Sections:
%              i. mean growth rate of fluctuating population
%             ii. percent change of fluct growth rate from constant


%  Strategy:
%              0. 


%  OK lez go!
